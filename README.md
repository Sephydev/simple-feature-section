## Overview

### Description

I present to you a small project I made. The main objective was to work with HTML, CSS and Flexbox to perfect my knowledge with those technologies.
It consist of a simple feature section containing a header and a main with three card-like section.
This project works on all device, from smartphone to desktop computer !

## My process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5
  - CSS
  - Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I've practiced some semantic HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The following snippets are some examples of the knowledges I used.

  - Semantic HTML5 (```<header>```):

```
    <header>
      <h1>Quality feedbacks for your SaaS products</h1>
      <p>The blocks & components you need</p>
    </header>
```

  - CSS (```.emoji```):
```
.emoji {
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 100%;
  padding: 0.75rem;
  margin-top: 1.5rem;
}
```

  - Flexbox (```main```):

```
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin-bottom: 3rem;
  gap: 3rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

Seeing how Flexbox is useful, I will continue to master this technologie.
I will do that by using it on other project, notably to make responsive design.
